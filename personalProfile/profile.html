		<p> Welcome to my profile page! I am Ariel, the seventh daughter of Triton who rules over the ocean. That makes me a princess. I used to be the only princess with red hair but now there's Merida. However I am the only mermaid princess. I am married to Prince Eric and we have a daughter named Melody. She's my pride and joy. However, she gets her looks from Eric so there are no more redheads in the family. </p>
